# PMLLib

A personal library to interface with ML ("AI") tools via Python.

# About

Initially this project was meant to be used in a Discord bot but I decided to rewrite it entirely, then later extract it into it's seperate repository. Because I used a git submodule in said project, I didn't create a proper Python package.
